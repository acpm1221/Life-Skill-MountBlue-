# Habits Assignment

## Question 1

The most interesting idea for me was BJ Fogg's push-up habit. He started
doing two push-ups every time he used the bathroom. He connected a new
habit to something he already did daily. Because the habit was very
small, he did not need much willpower. Slowly, he started doing more
push-ups and reached 50 a day.

## Question 2

B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.

-   **M (Motivation):** How much you want to do something.
-   **A (Ability):** How easy the task is.
-   **P (Prompt):** The reminder or trigger to do it.

To make a new habit easier, make it very simple. When the task is easy,
you do not need high motivation. For example, instead of flossing all
teeth, start with one tooth. When the prompt happens, you will do it
easily.

## Question 3

Celebrating after completing a habit is important. BJ Fogg calls this
"Shine." When you celebrate, you feel happy and proud. This good feeling
helps your brain remember the habit. When you feel good, you want to
repeat the action again.

## Question 4

The story of Dave Brailsford and British Cycling was very interesting.
He improved many small things by just 1%. He changed small details like
bike seats and sleeping habits. These small improvements made a big
difference. Over time, the team became world champions.

## Question 5

The book says real change starts with identity. Instead of saying, "I
want to lose weight," say, "I am a healthy person." Your habits show who
you are. Every small action is a vote for the person you want to become.

## Question 6

The book says to make good habits easy.

-   Reduce friction. Make the habit simple. For example, keep your book
    on your table if you want to read.
-   Use the Two-Minute Rule. Start with something that takes less than
    two minutes. This helps you begin easily.

## Question 7

To stop a bad habit, make it hard.

-   Add more steps before you do it.
-   For example, log out of social media apps after using them.
-   When it becomes difficult, you will do it less.

## Question 8

**Habit I want to do more: Drink more water.**

-   Make it obvious: Keep a water bottle on your desk.
-   Make it attractive: Use a nice bottle or add lemon.
-   Make it easy: Keep it close to you.
-   Make it satisfying: Mark it on a habit tracker or say "Good job" to
    yourself.

## Question 9

**Habit I want to reduce: Scrolling on my phone at night.**

-   Make it invisible: Keep the phone away before sleeping.
-   Make it unattractive: Think about feeling tired the next day.
-   Make it unsatisfying: Check screen time and see how much time is
    wasted.
