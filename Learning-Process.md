# Learning Process

## Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a simple way to learn something properly.  
You try to explain what you learned using very easy words, as if you are teaching a child.  
If you cannot explain it clearly, it means you need to study that part again.

## Question 2: What was the most interesting idea from the video?

One interesting idea is that the brain works like a **pinball machine**.  
When we focus hard, our thoughts move in fixed paths.  
When we relax, our thoughts can move freely and connect new ideas.

Another interesting story was about **Salvador Dalí and Thomas Edison**.  
They used a trick where they held keys or metal balls while resting.  
When the object fell, the sound woke them up, helping them capture creative ideas.
